# Home monitoring scripts

This is a repository of various scripts I run on my RasPi (Zero Wireless) to monitor my apartment and control physical things.

Scripts are made primarily for personal use but should have understandable CL interface and some documentation.

The ones utilizing cloud services have usually separate _credentials.json_ for secrets which are not pushed to remote.
